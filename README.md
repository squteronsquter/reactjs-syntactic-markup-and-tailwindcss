# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# How To Use Tailwind CSS With React

Setting Up Tailwind CSS In Your React Project With Ease

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework which makes it very easy to apply great styling to your React web application by choosing from the framework’s ready-made CSS classes. This easy approach makes Tailwind CSS very popular among today’s CSS frameworks and speeds up the development & styling process significantly. If you’re new to Tailwind CSS you can find a good starting point at the project’s homepage at [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Step 1: Creating Your React Project

```
npx create-react-app react-app-with-tailwind
cd react-app-with-tailwind
```

More [here](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/how-to-use-tailwind-css-with-react-9dd78bbdc0e0)

## Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS

Now that you have entered the newly created project folder _react-app-with-tailwind_ you can start adding the Tailwind CSS library and it’s peer dependencies postcss and autoprefixer by using the Node Package Manager (NPM) in the following way:

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

## Step 3: Generate Configuration Files

In order to configure everything we need for Tailwind in our React project we do need two configurations files:

- tailwind.config.js
- postcss.config.js

Luckily those two files can be generated by executing the following command in the project folder:

```
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## Step 4: Configure Path To Template Files

Inside _tailwind.config.js_ we need to specify the path to our React template files by adding the following configuration setting:

```
module.exports = {
   content: [
     "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
   ],
   theme: {
     extend: {},
   },
   plugins: [],
 }
```

## Step 5: Add Tailwind Directives

Add the following Tailwind CSS directives into file _index.css:_

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

That’s it. We’re ready to go! Let’s make use of Tailwind’s CSS classes within our main React component in _App.js_.

## Step 6: Use Tailwind CSS In Your React App

I added some other classes and content compared to the original tutorial, especially with regard to _media queries_ and syntactic _HTML markup_ instead of _visual_ eg. _div_ all around.

Replace the default code in _src/App.js_ with the following implementation:

```
function App() {
  return (
    <article className="w-96 m-auto md:container bg-gray-200 md:bg-gray-900 rounded-md md:rounded:lg shadow border p-4 mt-8 md:p-8 md:m-10">
      <h1 className="text-3xl text-gray-700 md:text-gray-50 font-bold mb-5">

      </h1>
      <h2 className="text-gray-500 md:text-gray-200 text-lg mb-16">

      </h2>
      <footer className="text-gray-500 md:text-gray-200">
        <hr />
        <p>
          Read{" "}
          <a
            className="text-blue-700 md:text-blue-300 underline"
            href="https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/how-to-use-tailwind-css-with-react-9dd78bbdc0e0"
          >
            this tutorial
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          From{" "}
          <a
            className="text-blue-700 md:text-blue-300 underline"
            href="https://medium.com/@s_eschweiler"
          >

          </a>
        </p>
      </footer>
    </article>
  );
}
export default App;

```

Start the development web server by using the following command:

```
npm run start
```

Open browser:

[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Production build

```
npm run build
```

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

```
npm install -g serve
serve -s build

```

_Happy Coding_
